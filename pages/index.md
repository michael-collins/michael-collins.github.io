Hello there! I am a multidisciplinary designer and educator with over a decade of experience. I have a passion for open source projects, design in its many forms, and I enjoy reading and writing about how design can be applied for positive future change.

### Background

I started my career designing and creating online learning technology and I am an advocate for the use of open-source technology in online education. My most recent collaboration includes a project called OER Schema â€“ a project that fosters free access to knowledge by helping open educational resources become interoperable. I have have produced a wide breadth of creative work including interactive art installations, web and product design, concept design, 3D animation, and I have been known to make furniture from time to time. The most recent art exhibition work I produced centered around digital privacy, identity, and security and I have two published book chapters that focus on open knowledge and learning. Currently, I work as the lead faculty coordinator for the multi-college Penn State World Campus Digital Multimedia Design program and I enjoy teaching art and design to students in a variety of subjects. I have been a long-time sub-committee volunteer for ACM SIGGRAPH, an organization whose mission is to nurture, champion, and connect researchers and practitioners of Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques.
