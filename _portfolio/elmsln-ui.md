Since 2008, I've worked with the [ELMS Learning Network](https://github.com/elmsln) project team in various capacities. This project, called "pipeline" is an example of a UI that I created which attempted to unify several different ELMS features that are implemented as interconnected Drupal instances. It also proposed non-existent features that were meant to inspire the programming team to think about additional ways of engaging online student learners. The ELMS Learning Network programmers prefer to have real HTML mockups to help them understand how the interface would work and how CSS would be applied, so I built the interface using the Zurb Foundation theme framework and heavily customized CSS.
