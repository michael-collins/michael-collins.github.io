I worked with an interdisciplinary team (Katrina Wehr, Alex Boyce) to develop the vocabulary to enable machine readable pedagogy for Open Educational Resources (OER) on the web. This is a precursor to more sophisticated course development tools and AI applications. We developed a W3C group, two faculty and staff workshops at Penn State University, and have presented at conferences across the United States.

I am currently working with the HAX development team at Penn State to integrate the vocabulary into the authoring platform. This will make writing schema into course content a trivial, and in some cases automatic, process.

In 2017, the OER Schema project was awarded a Discovery Grant through the [Center for Pedagogy in Art and Design](https://cpad.psu.edu/) (C-PAD).
