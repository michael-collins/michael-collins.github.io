[DMD 100: Multimedia Design Foundations](https://dmd-program.github.io/dmd-100-master/)

### Description:
<!-- ![DMD banner art](/assets/images/dmd-website-banner.jpg) -->

DMD 100: Digital Multimedia Design Foundations introduces design process and thinking skills to support and facilitate creative and reasoned approaches to ambiguous and ill-defined problem spaces. It introduces concepts, skills, language, and principles of practice related to art and design, communications, and information sciences â€” three discreet disciplines in which students can pursue further study while developing their learning pathways. With the aid of a standard design process, we walk through methods, tools, and mental attitudes necessary to approach ambiguous problems. This course is not meant to be a comprehensive design process catalog, and instead should inspire and build confidence in the act of design. The concept of "design" for DMD students is a frame through which complex issues can be discovered and defined and solutions can be best developed and delivered.
