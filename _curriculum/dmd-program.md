## Roles:

- Founding faculty and lead faculty from the Penn State School of Visual Arts.
- DMD program and course designer
- Course instructor

## Description:

The Digital Multimedia Design (DMD) Program is a fully online Bachelor of Design Program [offered through Penn State World Campus])(https://www.worldcampus.psu.edu/degrees-and-certificates/penn-state-online-digital-multimedia-design-bachelors-degree/overview). DMD promotes the values of imagination and creativity as human resources. **Digital** media generally refers to the storage and transmission of information in increasingly varied **multimedia** digital formats and devices, and within a changing array of modes of communication. **Design** is a means by which we respond to change in a purposeful way. By focusing on critical issues and opportunities, designers develop plans for taking innovative and strategic actions. Hence, digital design shapes and impacts the physical and virtual spaces people inhabit. Over the course of this program, students will produce projects that stimulate sound habits of mind, develop proficiencies of practice, and foster critical sensibilities for addressing issues.

[DMD 400: Digital Multimedia Design Capstone](https://dmd-program.github.io/dmd-400-master/)

The program is comprised of three program-exclusive spine courses and six prescribed \(required\) "core" courses â€“ two from each contributing college: Arts & Architecture, Communications, and Information Sciences & Technology. The core courses will provide skills and context pertinent to the disciplines from which they reside. The spine courses provide opportunities to frame and combine experiences from these disciplines.

In DMD 100: Digital Multimedia Design Foundations, students are exposed to a broad design perspective so they can apply it as a conceptual _frame_ for their studies. In DMD 300: Digital Multimedia Design Studio, students will apply their experiences from previous coursework to narrow their focus while producing projects in collaboration with their peers. DMD 400: Digital Multimedia Design Capstone is the capstone course in which they will create an entirely self-directed design project for inclusion in an online thesis project exhibition.

### Pathways

Though design is part of the core identity of the program, each student will develop their own pathway. A pathway is literally a sequence of courses. However, students have great control over choosing which courses to combine into a sequence. To help them get started, there are pre-made course sequences available on the [DMD Program Hub \(dmd.psu.edu\)](http://dmd.psu.edu).

### Projects

Students will develop capabilities necessary to use digital technologies in multimedia projects in prescribed, supporting, and additional courses. DMD 100 projects are designed for students with limited knowledge of digital production technology, but introduces foundational design knowledge that can be applied to all future DMD coursework. Final projects in the capstone course will be made available as part of portfolios and an online exhibition.
