I designed this special topics course for students with advanced knowledge of 3D tools to produce work at an advanced level, in both quality of craft as-well-as conceptual inquiry. Students are exposed to Maxon Cinema 4D and are expected to self-learn needed technical skills to achieve the goals of their work.
