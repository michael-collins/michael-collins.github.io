## Description:

This course is an in-residence digital studio course where students pursue their individual interests in the 3D digital medium. There are a series of exercises to acquaint students with tools such as Autodesk Maya, Adobe AfterEffects, Adobe Premiere, and Pixologic Z-Brush. I designed the course to be multi-tracked, enabling students to choose exercises that align with their interests and skill level. Students interested specifically in 3D animation tend to take the course multiple times, moving up to the advanced tracks built into the course. For their final projects, students produce a 15 - 30 second animation and accompanying artist statement.
