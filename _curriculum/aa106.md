## Description:

This is the second foundational course in the IDS program, where modules are  taught by a roation of digital artists and designers consisting of faculty in the School of Visual Arts. Content of the learning modules typically includes two and three-dimensional modeling, animation, sound, and game design concepts and processes. The students voted on one of three assignments to focus on for the duration of my roation, culminating in the production of illustrations using 3D modeling and rendering tools. Critique was held on the final class of my rotation.
