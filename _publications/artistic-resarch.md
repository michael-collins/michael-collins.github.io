## Abstract

The landscape of literature surrounding artistic research has expanded considerably in recent decades and the resistance to prescribing formal methodologies has been notable. By maintaining a breadth of perspectives that keep studio and performative practice at the core of inquiry, researchers open up the scope for applying artistic principles and practices in a variety of cultural, pedagogical and institutional contexts. In this chapter, the roles and practices of artistic researchers provide a theoretical lens for conceptualizing a pedagogical application informed by the praxis of artistic research. Praxis in this sense emphasizes the practical action of doing within a reflexive learning process mediated by personal conviction and social responsibility. The pedagogical implications require a review of the changing status of knowledge in the digital age; a focus on creative inquiry and critical response in art and design in digital studio settings; and the establishment of an interactive and collective online learning community. The pedagogy of artistic research is described in a case study of an undergraduate Bachelor of Design in Digital Multimedia Design (DMD) that is currently delivered in an online setting through The Pennsylvania State University World Campus in the United States.
