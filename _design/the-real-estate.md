The Real Estate was an animation manufactured to be commentary of artificial consumer realities. The pursuit of the American dream is reinterpreted as a superficial consumer act, spurred on through marketing and economic forces. This work uses marketing data that was extracted from a web-based real-estate ad for a cheap house for sale in Detroit, MI.
