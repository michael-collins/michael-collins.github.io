Tools: Adobe XD, Adobe Photoshop

I created UI and UX concepts for a major feature of ELMS called the Studio. Studio is place where students can go to find assignments, submit and share the work they have created, and can comment and critique the work of others as assignments dictate. The main design features are student progress dashboard, an assignment/lesson organization interface, a table of contents for course tasks, work submission gallery and discussion, and a content library.

This is an active project under development. I worked with the main studio developer to decide how to proceed with translating this design into web components that could be reused across the learning system. If you are interested in seeing how they are shaping up, you download and run storybook from this git repo: [lrnwebcomponents](https://github.com/elmsln/lrnwebcomponents).
