Tools: Adobe XD

{% include video id="302940448" provider="vimeo" %}

Grading many students across multiple assignments can be very time intensive, particularly without software to make finding, viewing, analyzing, and assessing work efficient and fluid. I used Adobe XD to build some wireframes that showed one possible solution that could to enable instructions to dynamically create any kind of student data view they would ever need. This would mean that a software interface would be more adaptable to different teaching and grading styles. Of course, this type of UI could be used for more than grading. It could be used as a configuration tool to render data statically, or be rendered as pre-set, filtered, and locked instances that would always display information in a particular manner.
